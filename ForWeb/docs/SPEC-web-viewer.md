# Spec: web-viewer

2026-10-04. Implementation authorized by the user; provider specification for ForWeb/web-viewer.

## Objective and boundaries
Reference host using public SDK, model input, diagnostics and camera controls. Depends on engine, web-adapters. Existing native provider contracts remain unchanged.

## Public contract
System semantic constraints are defined in [system design](system-technical-design.md). TypeScript signatures live in the owning src module and are exported through index.ts; API changes update this provider document first. Expected errors use Result with stable codes; no null/string error substitutes. Scene data is opaque and renderer layout is private. Cloud integration is independently optional.

## Structure and style
ForWeb/src/web-viewer/, ForWeb/tests/unit and contracts/gpu. C++ under native uses C++20, four spaces and snake_case; TS uses strict settings, four spaces, PascalCase types and camelCase functions. Example: `function dispose(): Promise<void>` is idempotent and never blocks the UI synchronously.

## Commands
From ForWeb: `pnpm run typecheck`; `pnpm run test:unit`; `pnpm run test:contracts`; `pnpm run test:gpu`; `pnpm run build`; `pnpm run test:sdk`. Native decoder: `pnpm run build:wasm`. Tests requiring hardware must not pass on a missing adapter.

## Verification and success criteria
Required cases: actual File/URL open, progress, cancel, pointer/keyboard, screenshots. Actual output/state must match the contract, not merely method invocation. Evidence records commands, versions, model/shader hashes and skipped devices. Performance runs are separate from unit tests.

## Boundaries
Always: validate inputs and resource arithmetic, preserve ownership/identity, test failures, pin dependencies. Review new scope/public semantics before changing them; routine authorized fixes proceed. Never: silently drop points/SH, bypass failing tests, copy unlicensed code, publish model files or credentials.
